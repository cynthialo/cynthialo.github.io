# Then ...

From 2007-2017, I was a faculty member in Energy, Environmental & Chemical Engineering at [Washington University](http://www.wustl.edu) in St. Louis, Missouri.  My [research group](research.md) focused on applying data science and quantum chemistry to engineering problems in catalysis, electronic materials, and biological photosynthesis.

Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Physical and Chemical Properties Division at the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov) in Gaithersburg, Maryland ([research](https://www.nist.gov/mml/csd/chemical-informatics-research-group) [group](http://chem.uaf.edu/trainor/)).  

I received my PhD and MS in Chemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ([research group](http://web.mit.edu/troutgroup/)), and my BS in Chemical Engineering and Chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley.
